In this study we presented a two-step preprocessing method to reduce position-inaccuracy induced artefacts in SAFT reconstructions through correcting the unknown positional error. 
Since the errors in the available information are independent, we devised the first part of the preprocessing as a TLS polynomial regression problem to estimate the scatterer positions. The second part is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem to estimate and correct the tracking error, which can be solved via Newton's method as its Hessian matrix is very easy to compute. Simulation studies have demonstrated that the proposed method can tolerate larger error and achieve higher resolution than reconstructing without preprocessing. Considering the physical size of the signal source in actual measurements, which alone impairs the resolution of SAFT reconstructions, our method has the potential to greatly reduce error-induced artefacts and realize previously unreachable imaging quality for manual inspection.
