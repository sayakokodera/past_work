%%% Abstract
There have been developments in nondestructive ultrasonic testing (UT) to assist manual operation for easier and more reliable inspection than conventional ones. Although such system also opens up the possibility to post-process the measurement data for improving imaging quality, manual UT is prone to stochastic observational errors, such as inaccuracy in estimating scan positions or varying coupling, which may cause strong artefacts formation in its reconstruction. %
In an attempt to reduce the positional-inaccuracy induced artefacts, in this work we propose a preprocessing method to correct the unknown positional error from the measurement data and the erroneous positional information. %As the first step of the preprocessing, the positions of the signal sources are estimated via robust polynomial regression. In the next step, the tracking error is estimated and corrected iteratively by modeling the measurement data based on the estimation results from the first step. 
We demonstrate through simulations that the proposed method is more resistant to positional error and can achieve higher resolution, which is comparable to that of the reconstruction with the exact positional information, than the reconstruction without preprocessing.
