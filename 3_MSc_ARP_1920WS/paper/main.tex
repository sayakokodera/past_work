\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

%Your introduction motivates the problem again, emphasizing why it is important
%and what are the practical applications. Use references wherever possible to support
%your points. The introduction also introduces the state of the art, citing journal
%papers \cite{Shannon:48}, conference papers \cite{Haykin:07}, books \cite{Mittelbach:2004},  
%standards, RFCs, and other references. The use of BibTeX to organize your references is
%strongly encouraged. Try to avoid using websites as sources since these may change
%over time.
%
%After providing the state of the art, you should emphasize what are the novelties of your proposed 
%solution and how it differs from the existing ones. Why would anyone need your solution?

\section{Employed Optimization Techniques} % change the section name
In the proposed method of this study, two different optimization techniques are used, namely the total least-squares (TLS) and the Newton's method. The former is employed to estimate the scatterer positions, whereas the latter is applied to correct the tracking error  based on the estimated scatterer positions. In this section, the basic ideas and approaches of those techniques are presented.

%as possible, including all assumptions that were made (e.g., uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
%channels or isotropic antenna elements). The reader should be able to reproduce your 
%simulation results based on your descriptions!

%Similarly, if measurements were performed, the measurement setup and equipment

Performance of the proposed method was examined through two simulation studies: the simulation \rom{1} shows the error sensitivity of the proposed method, while the simulation \rom{2} illustrates the impact of the ROI depth. The former seeks to provide the insight to assess whether the proposed method is appropriate for the selected measurement assistance system whose error deviation is known as a part of the device specifications. The simulation \rom{2}, on the other hand, is aimed to determine from and up to which ROI depth it is worthwhile to correct the error, since the impact of the horizontal deviation varies with the ROI depth. \par
