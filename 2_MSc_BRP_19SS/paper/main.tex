\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

%Your introduction motivates the problem again, emphasizing why it is important
%and what are the practical applications. Use references wherever possible to support
%your points. The introduction also introduces the state of the art, citing journal
%papers \cite{Shannon:48}, conference papers \cite{Haykin:07}, books \cite{Mittelbach:2004},  
%standards, RFCs, and other references. The use of BibTeX to organize your references is
%strongly encouraged. Try to avoid using websites as sources since these may change
%over time.
%
%After providing the state of the art, you should emphasize what are the novelties of your proposed 
%solution and how it differs from the existing ones. Why would anyone need your solution?

%This section may for instance be a ``simulations'' section if the verification is based
%on computer simulations. In this case, please remember to indicate the simulations setup as completely
%as possible, including all assumptions that were made (e.g., uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
%channels or isotropic antenna elements). The reader should be able to reproduce your 
%simulation results based on your descriptions!
%
%Similarly, if measurements were performed, the measurement setup and equipment 
%as well as your test conditions must be described in detail and the outcome should
%be discussed.
%
%The description of your main results which may of course also span more than one section.
%Point out its main features, discuss its limitations, compare it to alternative solutions.
%
%All results that you show should be interpreted properly -- what do we learn from them?

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
In this study, a possible solution to handle positional inaccuracy for SAFT reconstruction was presented. We have derived the spatial approximation of SAFT reconstruction matrix and proposed an iterative process to improve positional accuracy. The performance of the proposed method was examined through simulations, revealing two major problems to overcome for incorporating this approach into reconstruction process. First, for successful error correction the deviation between the falsely computed A-Scan model and the measurement data should be large enough. This suggests that we should initiate error correction, only when the deviation in A-Scan is large enough. Second, the proposed method becomes susceptive to positional error when the scan position moves away from a scatterer. As a countermeasure, we can apply a spatial filter to suppress the contribution of the measurement data taken far away from the scatterer. Based on these findings, an example measurement data set was reconstructed, in which artefacts are significantly reduced with the proposed method.
