%%% Abstract
Although ultrasonic testing (UT) still requires a lot of manual operations, reliability of manual UT has remained highly dependent on human factors. However, a measurement assistance system makes manual UT reproducible, opening up the possibility of post-processing the measurement data to further increase the inspection reliability. Nevertheless, manual UT is prone to systematic errors which degrade the reconstruction quality significantly. %
This study concerns a possible solution to handle positional inaccuracy for SAFT reconstruction. In an attempt to reduce artefacts in reconstruction, we aim to correct the positional information and modify the reconstruction system with its spatial approximation in an iterative manner. Through simulations, we have found the position dependency of the method and derived countermeasures. Example reconstruction results are provided, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

%Although ultrasonic testing (UT) still requires a lot of manual operations, manual UT data has not been considered to be post-processed. However, a measurement assistance system provides adequate information and opens up the possibility of post-processing manual UT data. Since manual inspection is prone to systematic errors, it is essential to find proper ways to handle such errors for a successful reconstruction. %
